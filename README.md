# Smart-Robotic-Garbage-Management-System
The proposed automated robotic dustbin can sense human being approaching towards it and opens the upper lid and alerts the user to use the dustbin. If the waste falls outside the dustbin it can sense and alert the user.
To solve the problems, IR, Ultrasonic Sensor, Camera and robotics technologies could be
used to reduce cleanerâ€™s workload and assure a clean environment. The Camera can
rotate and capture image. The captured image is processed and detect the waste product
or material and put a laser light beam to it. The LDR follows the light and reach the
waste material. The robotic smartbin can capture the waste and put it into the bin. The
robotic smart bin can detect the dry and wet material put into it and dump it into the
respective chamber.
